		This is where you may insert text about the app for your library. Since this is a demo app, we have provided relevant information below that may facilitate your use of this app.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Please contact Datalogics to create a Vendor ID for your demo.</strong> Your login will authenticate you through the ILS and then Adobe’s DRM system.
	</p>
	<p>Library Simplified is capable of combining multiple content sources into one convenient catalog. Once logged in, you should be able to view and read a collection of content from two different sources: an Open Access server hosted by NYPL, and a demo ebook server running Adobe Content Server hosted by Datalogics for development purposes. Unlike NYPL’s SimpleE, we do not connect to content sources for Overdrive, 3M and Baker-Taylor; these connections will be deployed when the app is built for libraries.</p>
	<p>For demonstration purposes, the Library Simplified service is running in AWS. User authentication checks with a test Vendor ID service. Both of these services are operated and hosted by Datalogics for demo purposes. This system is replicable at libraries.</p>
